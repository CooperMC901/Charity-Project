            <p class="aboutdesc">At Cooper's dog charity, we provide dogs the long, happy, and healthy lives they deserve to live.  We supply housing, food, and shelter to dogs only and proudly are located in Tupelo, MS. Thanks to the generous donations of our community, we continue to operate as a non-profit and plan to operate this way for decades to come.</p>

            <h3>How can I help?</h3>
            <p class="howtohelp">Cooper's Dog Charity is currently accepting applications for volunteers throughout the 2022 winter. These volunteers will be expected to involve themselves with the community to rescue animals out of the cold, harsh conditions.
